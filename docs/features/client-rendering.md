# Client-rendering

Parcel Prototyper allows you to write templates once, and re-use them at build time and in the browser.

This allows you to do things like re-hydrate a page with data generated by the user of the prototype, or to re-use components in the client for interactive elements, such as adding new items to a to-do list.

## Using client rendering

For supported asset types, all assets found in the asset folder are compiled into a JavaScript bundle and automatically added to every `.html` output file for you.

From there, you can follow the best-practices for the given asset type (see above) on using the templates in the browser.
